# Exploring Florence-2 Model for Image Processing Tasks

This repository contains a Colab notebook demonstrating the use of the pre-trained Florence-2 model from Hugging Face for various image processing tasks including image captioning, segmentation, OCR, dense captioning, and region text extraction.

## Project Overview

Florence-2 is a state-of-the-art model designed to handle a wide range of image processing tasks with remarkable accuracy and efficiency. This project leverages the power of Florence-2 to explore the following tasks:
- **Image Captioning**: Generating detailed captions for images.
- **Image Segmentation**: Breaking down images into segments.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Extracting text from images.
- **Dense Captioning**: Generating comprehensive captions for multiple regions within an image.
- **Region Text Extraction**: Extracting text from specific regions within images.

## Colab Notebook

The project is implemented in a Google Colab notebook to take advantage of GPU acceleration for efficient processing. You can access and run the notebook directly in Colab using the following link:

[Open in Colab](https://github.com/ibad321/Florence-2-Model-for-Cv-task/blob/main/florence_2_model.ipynb)

## Getting Started

To get started, simply open the Colab notebook link and follow the instructions provided in the notebook. Ensure you have access to a GPU for optimal performance.

## Dependencies

The notebook uses the following libraries:
- `transformers`
- `torch`
- `PIL`

These dependencies are pre-installed in the Colab environment.

## How to Use

1. Open the Colab notebook link.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the Florence-2 model and perform the image processing tasks.
3. Experiment with different images and observe the results.
